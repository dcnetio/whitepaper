DC, as a decentralized cloud service platform, operates as a distributed network open for participation and utilization by everyone. Over time, the governance of the DC network will transition to community control. In this network, whether they are cloud service space providers, users, or various stakeholders involved in maintaining the system, all can freely join or leave, provided they adhere to the system's protocols. The economic model of DC is designed to preserve the interests of all participants and to ensure the sustainable development of the entire DC system.
